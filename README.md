# Neige

> **Warning**
> Neige is still highly experimental, use at your own risks!

Neige is a simple evaluator of Python/Julia code using tree-sitter to match expressions under the cursor and send them to a connected session. The experience is highly inspired by the awesome [julia-vscode extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).

## Usage

Install Neige as any neovim lua package using your favorite package manager and make sure to call `require("neige").instantiate({})` at least once (required only for Julia).

Using [paq-nvim](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim)

```lua
require "paq" {
    -- ...
    {'Pangoraw/Neige.jl', run = function()
        require("neige").instantiate({ popup = true })
    end};
    -- ...
}
```

### Setup

One can change the settings for Neige using a call to `neige.setup(config)`.
The default settings are the following:

```lua
require("neige").setup({
    python_exe = "python",
    julia_exe = "julia",
    julia_opts = {
        threads = "auto",
        quiet = true,
    },
    julia_load_revise = false,
    icons = {
        failure = "âœ—",
        success = "âœ“",
        loading = "ðŸ—˜",
    },
    hl = {
        failure = "DiagnosticError",
        success = "DiagnosticInfo",
        loading = "DiagnosticInfo",
    },
    split = "vnew",
    clear_on_start = false,
})
```

### Running

After having installed Neige, a new Python/Julia REPL can be started using the `:NeigeStart` command which will split the newly created REPL in a new pane.

When the REPL is created, expressions can be sent to the REPL using the `:NeigeEvalExpr` command. It is recommended to map this command to the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> bindings to mimic the vscode extension.
The last two mappings for starting Neige and clearing the virtual texts are also recommended.

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<s-cr>', [[:NeigeEvalExpr<CR>]], { noremap = true})
vim.keymap.set('v', '<s-cr>', [[:<C-U>NeigeEvalVisual<CR>]], { noremap = true})
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ns', [[:NeigeStart<CR>]])
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>nc', [[:NeigeClearText<CR>]])
```

## Dependencies

To have fun with Neige, you will need the following:
 - `neovim >= 0.8` (might work with earlier versions but not tested).
 - [`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/).

For using in Python scripts:

 - The [`python` grammar](github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python) for tree-sitter installed (use `:TSInstall python`).
 - `python` (or `ipython`) installed.
 - the `pynvim` package installed to the provided python installation.

For using in Julia scripts:
 - The [`julia` grammar](github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-julia) for tree-sitter installed (use `:TSInstall julia`).
 - `julia >= 1.7` installed (again not tested with a lower version).

## TODOs

 - [x] Make eval request asynchronous (it currently blocks the editor, not ideal for Julia's compile times)
 - [ ] Highlight stack trace lines
 - [ ] Function to send visual selection
 - [ ] Improve node handling (when there are no node under the cursor)
 - [ ] Improve virtual text cleanup when lines are edited

## Acknowledgements

 - [lab.nvim](https://github.com/0x100101/lab.nvim/) - The virtual text implementation of Neige is currently copy-pasted from lab.
